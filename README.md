## About this repo
Practice code for using the sv128 vector library.
### What is sv128?
sv128 is for teaching purposes. It is a C++ library that simulates common vector instructions with a 128-bit vector width (e.g., loading/storing 4 floats simultaneously, or performing addition/multiplication on 4 floats at once), allowing users to practice vectorized thinking without delving into assembly language.
### sv128 compiler setup
